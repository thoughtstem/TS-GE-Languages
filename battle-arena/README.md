# battle-arena

This is a language for creating battle royale games with
custom weapons.

It's meant for educational purposes.

It's meant to be fun.  Think of it like a toy (as opposed to "game": see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Crawford_on_Game_Design).  But it happens to be a toy that produces games...

We use it to teach coding in a fun and interactive way.
