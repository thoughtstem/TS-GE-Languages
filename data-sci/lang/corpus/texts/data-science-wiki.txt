==History==
The term "data science" has appeared in various contexts over the past thirty years but did not become an established term until recently. In an early usage, it was used as a substitute for [[computer science]] by [[Peter Naur]] in 1960. Naur later introduced the term "[[datalogy]]".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Naur|first1=Peter|title=The science of datalogy|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 July 1966|volume=9|issue=7|pages=485|doi=10.1145/365719.366510}}</ref> In 1974, Naur published ''Concise Survey of Computer Methods'', which freely used the term data science in its survey of the contemporary data processing methods that are used in a wide range of applications.

The modern definition of "data science" was first sketched during the second Japanese-French statistics symposium organized at the [[Montpellier 2 University|University of Montpellier II]] (France) in 1992<ref name="Escoufier">{{Cite book|language=english|author1=Escoufier et al., editors|title=Data Science and its Application|section=Preface|place=Tokyo|publisher=Academic Press|date=1995|isbn=0-12-241770-4}}</ref>. The attendees acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline with a specific focus on data from various origins, dimensions, types and structures. They shaped the contour of this new science based on established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with the extensive use of the increasing power of computer tools.

In 1996, members of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) met in Kobe for their biennial conference. Here, for the first time, the term data science is included in the title of the conference ("Data Science, classification, and related methods"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/|title=A Very Short History Of Data Science|first=Gil|last=Press}}</ref> after the term was introduced in a roundtable discussion by Chikio Hayashi.<ref name="Hayashi">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/book/9784431702085|title=Data Science, Classification, and Related Methods|last=Hayashi|first=Chikio|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Springer Japan|isbn=9784431702085|editor-last=Hayashi|editor-first=Chikio|series=Studies in Classification, Data Analysis, and Knowledge Organization|location=|pages=40–51|language=en|chapter=What is Data Science?

In this lecture, he characterized statistical work as a trilogy of data collection, data modeling and analysis, and decision making. In his conclusion,
he initiated the modern, non-computer science, usage of the term "data science" and advocated that statistics be renamed data science and statisticians data scientists.<ref name="cfjwutk"/>

In 2001, William S. Cleveland introduced data science as an independent discipline, extending the field of statistics to incorporate "advances in computing with data" in his article "Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics," which was published in Volume 69, No. 1, of the April 2001 edition of the International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique.<ref name="cleveland01">Cleveland, W.

International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique, 21–26</ref> In his report, Cleveland establishes six technical areas which he believed to encompass the field of data science: multidisciplinary investigations, models and methods for data, computing with data, pedagogy, tool evaluation, and theory.

==Relationship to statistics==
"Data science" has recently become a popular term among business executives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2015/05/21/data-science-white-hot/|title=Data science is still white hot, but nothing lasts forever|last=Darrow|first=Barb|date=May 21, 2015|work=Fortune|access-date=November 20, 2017}}</ref> However, many critical academics and journalists see no distinction between data science and [[statistics]], whereas others consider it largely a popular term for "data mining" and "big data".<ref name=":3" /> Writing in [[Forbes]], Gil Press argues that data science is a [[buzzword]] without a clear definition and has simply replaced “[[business analytics]]” in contexts such as graduate degree programs.<ref name="GilPress">{{cite web|title=Data Science: What's The Half-Life Of A Buzzword?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/08/19/data-science-whats-the-half-life-of-a-buzzword/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=2013-08-19}}</ref> In the question-and-answer section of his keynote address at the Joint Statistical Meetings of [[American Statistical Association]], noted applied statistician [[Nate Silver]] said, “I think data-scientist is a sexed up term for a statistician....Statistics is a branch of science.

On the other hand, responses to criticism are as numerous. In a 2014 [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] article, Irving Wladawsky-Berger compares the data science enthusiasm with the dawn of [[computer science]]. He argues data science, like any other [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field, employs [[Methodology|methodologies]] and practices from across the [[Academy|academia]] and [[industry]], but then it will morph them into a new [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]. He brings to attention the sharp criticisms of computer science, now a well respected academic discipline, had to once face.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/05/02/why-do-we-need-data-science-when-weve-had-statistics-for-centuries/|title=Why Do We Need Data Science When We’ve Had Statistics for Centuries?|last=Wladawsky-Berger|first=Irving|date=May 2, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=November 20, 2017}}</ref> Likewise, [[New York University|NYU]] [[NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights|Stern's]] Vasant Dhar, as do many other academic proponents of data science,<ref name=":1" /> argues more specifically in December 2013 that data science is different from the existing practice of data analysis across all [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]], which focuses only on explaining [[data set]]s. Data science seeks actionable and consistent [[Pattern recognition|pattern]] for [[Predictive modelling|predictive uses]].<ref name=":0" />  This practical engineering goal takes data science beyond traditional [[analytics]]. Now the data in those disciplines and [[Applied science|applied fields]] that lacked solid [[Theory|theories]], like [[health science]] and [[social science]], could be sought and utilized to generate powerful predictive models.<ref name=":0" />

In an effort similar to Dhar's, Stanford professor [[David Donoho]], in September 2015, takes the proposition further by rejecting three simplistic and misleading definitions of data science in lieu of criticisms.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Donoho|first=David|date=September 2015|title=50 Years of Data Science|url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf|journal=Based on a Talk at Tukey Centennial Workshop, Princeton NJ Sept 18 2015|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> First, for Donoho, data science does not equate to [[big data]], in that the size of the data set is not a criterion to distinguish data science and statistics.<ref name=":2" /> Second, data science is not defined by the [[computing]] skills of sorting big data sets, in that these skills are already generally used for analyses across all disciplines.<ref name=":2" /> Third, data science is a heavily applied field where [[Graduate school|academic programs]] right now do not sufficiently prepare data scientists for the jobs, in that many [[Graduate school|graduate programs]] misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Culture of Big Data|last=Barlow|first=Mike|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdBXAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22data%20science%22&f=false}}</ref> As a [[statistician]], [[David Donoho|Donoho]], following many in his field, champions the broadening of learning scope in the form of data science,<ref name=":2" /> like John Chambers who urges statisticians to adopt an inclusive concept of learning from data,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=John M.|date=1993-12-01|title=Greater or lesser statistics: a choice for future research|journal=Statistics and Computing|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=182–184|doi=10.1007/BF00141776|issn=0960-3174}}</ref> or like William Cleveland who urges to prioritize extracting from data applicable [[Predictive modelling|predictive tools]] over [[Explanatory model|explanatory theories.]]<ref name="cleveland01" /> Together, these [[statistician]]s envision an increasingly inclusive applied field that grows out of traditional [[statistics]] and beyond.

For the future of data science, Donoho projects an ever-growing environment for [[open science]] where data sets used for [[Academic publishing|academic publications]] are accessible to all researchers.<ref name=":2" /> [[National Institutes of Health|US National Institute of Health]] has already announced plans to enhance reproducibility and transparency of research data.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Francis S.|last2=Tabak|first2=Lawrence A.|date=2014-01-30|title=NIH plans to enhance reproducibility|journal=Nature|volume=505|issue=7485|pages=612–613|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4058759|pmid=24482835|doi=10.1038/505612a}}</ref> Other big [[Academic journal|journals]] are likewise following suit.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McNutt|first=Marcia|date=2014-01-17|title=Reproducibility|journal=Science|language=en|volume=343|issue=6168|pages=229|doi=10.1126/science.1250475|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24436391}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peng|first=Roger D.|date=2009-07-01|title=Reproducible research and Biostatistics|journal=Biostatistics|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=405–408|doi=10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014|pmid=19535325|issn=1465-4644}}</ref> This way, the future of data science not only exceeds the boundary of [[Statistical theory|statistical theories]] in scale and methodology, but data science will revolutionize current academia and [[Paradigm|research paradigms]].<ref name=":2" /> As Donoho concludes, "the scope and impact of data science will continue to expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available."<ref name=":2" />
