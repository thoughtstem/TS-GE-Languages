Tijuana is located on the [[Gold Coast (Baja California)|Gold Coast]] of [[Baja California]], and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of [[Tijuana Municipality]] (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the [[North America]]n continent, the city maintains facilities of many [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca.<ref name="Cultural Mecca1">{{Cite news |first=Adam |last=Piore |title=How to Build a Creative City |magazine=Newsweek International |date=September 2, 2002 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Tijuana is the [[Largest cities in the Americas|45th largest city]] in the [[Americas]] and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the [[Metropolitan areas of Mexico|fifth-largest in Mexico]], with a population of 1,840,710,<ref name="cuentame.inegi.org.mx"/> but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.

Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.

Tijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the [[The Californias|Californias]]. As the American conquest of northern Mexico ended with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, ''T.J.'', and nicknamed ''Gateway to Mexico'', the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.

==Name==
===Etymology===
The city's name comes from the [[Ranchos of California|rancho]] that [[Santiago Argüello]] Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it ''Rancho Tía Juana''.<ref name=parks>http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1054/files/sanysidro.pdf</ref>

The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as ''La Tía Juana'', ''Tiguana'', ''Tiuana'', ''Tiwana'', ''Tijuan'', ''Ticuan'', as well as ''Tijuana''.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2019}} While the Mexican city standardized to ''Tijuana'', the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]] remained ''Tía Juana' until the mid-20th century.

The commonly accepted theory among historians is that ''Tía Juana'', as Argüello named his rancho, is derived from the word {{lang|dih|Tiwan}} ("by the sea") in the [[Kumeyaay language|language of the Kumeyaay]] – the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that ''Tía Juana'', which means "Aunt Jane" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Argüello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho Tía Juana.<ref name="Niemann2002">{{cite book|author=Greg Niemann|title=Baja Legends: The Historic Characters, Events, and Locations That Put Baja California on the Map|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35WQOduN1F4C&pg=PA61|year=2002|publisher=Sunbelt Publications, Inc.|isbn=978-0-932653-47-5|pages=61–}}</ref>

===Nicknames===
In [[Southern California]], Tijuana is often referred to as ''TJ'' or ''T.J.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/travel/tijuana-mexico-border.html|last=Khan|first=Sarah|title=Through a Tijuana Turnstile and Into Tacos and Tortas|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 February 2018|accessdate=29 May 2019}}</ref> Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as ''Tiyei''. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is ''Tijuanense'', while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is ''Tijuanero''.

The nickname ''Tijuas'' is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase ''Yo Tijuaneo, ¿y tú?'' translates to ''I Tijuanate, and you?''. This term comes from a new popular local verb ''Tijuanear'' meaning ''to Tijuana'', describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

[[File:Vizcaino.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sebastián Vizcaíno]]]]
===Origins===
The land was originally inhabited by the [[Kumeyaay]], a tribe of [[Yuman]]-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] toured the coastline of the area, which [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] mapped in 1602. In 1769, [[Juan Crespí]] documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. [[Junípero Serra]] founded the first mission of [[Alta California]] in nearby San Diego.

Further settlement took place near the end of the mission era when [[José María de Echeandía]], governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to [[Santiago Argüello]] in 1829. This large cattle ranch, [[Rancho Tía Juana]], covered {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}}. Although "Tia Juana" means "Aunt Jane" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tijuán' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.<ref>https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v50-1/rancho_tiajuana.pdf</ref>

In 1848, as a result of the [[Mexican–American War]] with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.<ref>Instituto de Investigaciones Históricas https://web.archive.org/web/20130117131949/http://www.tijuana.gob.mx/ciudad/CiudadHistoriaMinima.asp</ref>
===1889-1915: Town established===
Urban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Argüello and [[Agustin Olvera|Augustín Olvera]] entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city.<ref>As determined at the second Symposium of History, 1975.</ref> Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called "excursionists" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel "[[Ramona]]" by [[Helen Hunt Jackson]].

In 1911, during the [[Mexican Revolution]], revolutionaries claiming loyalty to [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the "defensores de Tijuana", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the [[United States Army]].

The [[Panama-California Exposition]] of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a ''Feria Típica Mexicana'' – Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.

===1916-1935: Gambling and drinking destination===
The first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great "Hatfield rainmaker" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new [[Agua Caliente Racetrack|Agua Caliente]] track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.

Legal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during [[prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. The [[Avenida Revolución]] area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the [[Caesar salad]].

In 1925, the city attempted to shed its negative image of hedonism and lawlessness created by American mob empresarios by renaming itself ''Zaragosa'', but its name soon reverted to ''Tijuana''.

In 1928, the [[Agua Caliente Touristic Complex]] was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. [[Rita Hayworth]] was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as "la Faraona" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the "minarete" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.
===1935-1965: Tourism broadens===
In 1935, President Cárdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria Lázaro Cárdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.

With increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.
[[File:Maquiladora.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Established maquiladoras in Tijuana and the border towns with the U.S. in the mid-1960s.<ref>Carruthers (2000), page 212</ref>]]

With the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.

===1965-2001: The city matures===
In 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open [[maquiladoras]] (factories),<ref>''The Human Race: Escaping From History''. Employee turnover is also relatively high, p. 52.</ref> and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.

In 1972, work began on the first [[Channelization (rivers)|concrete channeling]] of the [[Tijuana River]]; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called ''Cartolandia'' (“Paperland”).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the [[Zona Río]] was built. With the 1981 opening of the [[Plaza Río Tijuana]] mall and the 1982 [[Tijuana Cultural Center]] (CECUT), Zona Río became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled ''glorietas'' (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand [[Paseo de la Reforma]] in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.<ref>http://www.el-mexicano.com.mx/informacion/suplementos/2/40/identidad/2011/01/23/450718/historia-de-las-inundaciones-en-tijuana</ref><ref>https://m.sandiegoreader.com/news/2000/mar/09/feature-tijuana-aztec-high-tech/</ref>

In 1994, [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]] was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.

===2001-2011: Violence and decline of US tourism===
After [[9/11]], tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=ViMUCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA67</ref>
Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to [[Bonita, Californi|Bonita]] and Eastlake in [[Chula Vista, California]] to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in [[The Los Angeles Times]] wrote, “So many upper-class Mexican families live in…Eastlake…and Bonita…that…the area is becoming a gilded colony of Mexicans, where speaking English is optional and people can breathe easy cruising around in their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs."<ref>https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2008/06/tijuanas-elite.html</ref>

===2011-present Tijuana strengthens===
In recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a big number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.

== Geography ==
[[File:Cerrocolorado.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Colorado Hill, the highest elevation of Tijuana.]]
Tijuana is the western-most city in Mexico, and consequently in [[Latin America]], and the 2nd largest city of northern Mexico. Located about {{convert|210|km|mi|sp=us}} west of the state-capital, [[Mexicali]], the city is bordered to the north by the cities of [[Imperial Beach]], and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is [[Rosarito Beach]], while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled [[Tijuana River]].

Housing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to {{convert|790|m|ft}}.

Tijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill ([[Cerro Colorado (borough)|Cerro Colorado]]) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.

The city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an [[intermittent river]], {{convert|195|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and [[Southern California]] in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California–Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of [[Imperial Beach]].

As [[Downtown Tijuana]] was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.

The Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the [[San Diego skyline]] can also be seen.

===Boroughs and neighborhoods===
The municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or ''Delegaciones''. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into [[Colonia (Mexico)|colonia]]s or [[ejido]]s. These boroughs offer administrative services such as [[urban planning]], [[civil registry]], inspection, verification, [[public work]]s and community development and are served by a ''delegado''.

===Climate===
Tijuana's climate is a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh''),<ref>{{cite journal|author=M. Kottek|author2=J. Grieser |author3=C. Beck |author4=B.

[[File:Tijuana River Estuary.jpg|thumb|Tijuana River Estuary with Tijuana Hills in the back]]

During the rainy season, November through March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to [[June Gloom]], is observed created by [[marine layer]]. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average {{convert|13.6|C|F}}. In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of [[Santa Ana winds]] – observed in Southern California as well. Though the daytime highs are generally around {{convert|20|C|F}}, heat waves can reach up to {{convert|33|C|F}}. The hottest months in the city, also the dry season, are August and September, during which temperatures average {{convert|22.0|C|F}}. Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the [[California Current]] and the [[North Pacific High]] suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the [[North American Monsoon]]. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.<ref name=Adams>{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=David |last2=Comrie |first2=Andrew |year=1997 |title=The North American Monsoon |journal= Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=2197–2213 |doi= 10.1175/1520-0477(1997)078<2197:TNAM>2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

[[Frost]] and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city. During this time heavy snowfall was also observed in the [[Cuyamaca Mountains]] of San Diego County.

The record low temperature recorded in the city was {{convert|-6|C|F}}, while the highest was {{convert|49|C|F}}.{{citation-needed|date=May 2018}}

Tijuana has a diverse [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably [[Cubans]], and [[Guatemalans]], have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/sd-me-haitians-tijuana-20171026-story.html|title=Article|website=www.sandiegouniontribune.com}}</ref>

[[File:Tijuana Border Traffic.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Tijuana's traffic near the Mexico-USA international borderline.]]

The majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from [[Sinaloa]], [[Michoacán]], [[Jalisco]], [[Oaxaca]], and the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]]. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's "magnet status" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.

Tijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three [[hectares]] a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} that has led to the unregulated, illegal [[squatter]] homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.

Squatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide safe homes and a sense of land ownership, to escape and isolate their families and young ones from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas, these outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug lords plantations for narcotics, and delinquency spreads to even areas that are considered safe havens, which periodically come to light in the newspapers.

National Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.

[[File:Border USA Mexico.jpg|left|300px|thumb|[[Mexico–United States barrier|Border fence]] between Tijuana (right) and San Diego's border patrol offices (left)]]

While the [[INEGI]] Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tijuana Striving for Better Days |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/oct/07/tijuana-striving-for-better-days/ |publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref> As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been [[rasterize]]d{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and [[suburbanization]] outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.

According to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, the city or ''settlement'' of Tijuana only covers ⅔ of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), composed of Tijuana Municipality and [[Rosarito Beach Municipality]], has 1,751,302 inhabitants. [[Tecate Municipality]], adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of [[Tecate]]; [[Valley of the Palms]] is a large [[planned city]] between the two.

{{As of|2005}} the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of [[Christianity]]. The denominations are further divided into followers of [[Catholicism]] – 61% – and of [[Protestantism]] – 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include [[Taoism]] (among other Asian and European religions), [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]] is also found.

===Crime===
Tijuana is the birthplace and base of the [[Tijuana Cartel]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Tijuana Cartel|url=https://sites.google.com/site/violenceacrosstheborder/announcements/tijuana-cartel|accessdate=25 September 2011|newspaper=Violence across the border}}</ref>  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent [[Crime in Mexico|crime]] related to gang violence, in part derived from the [[Mexican drug war]] and [[human trafficking]].

During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public.

==Government==

===Region===
[[File:TijuanaGovernmentPalace.jpg|thumb|Palacio de Gobierno de Tijuana (Tijuana City Hall)]]

At present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN), [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI), and [[Ecologist Green Party of Mexico]] (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.

Less prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the [[New Alliance Party (Mexico)|New Alliance Party]] (PANAL), [[Social Encounter Party]] (PES), and [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the "Alliance for Better Living" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).

===International===
Tijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreign Embassies and Consulates in Mexico |url=http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/mexico# |publisher=GoAbroad.com |accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Economy==

===Manufacturing===

[[File:Playas skyscraper.jpg|thumb|Building at Playas de Tijuana]]
[[File:Tijuana vista Link.jpg|thumb|222x222px|Panoramic view of Tijuana]]

Tijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader [[Minneapolis - Saint Paul]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Analysis by Crossborder Group Finds Tijuana #1 City in North America for Medical Device Manufacturing Employment |url=http://crossbordergroup.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/analysis-by-crossborder-group-finds-tijuana-1-city-in-north-america-for-medical-device-manufacturing-employment/ |accessdate=August 14, 2011 |publisher=Tijuana Economic Development Corporation|date=2011-07-19 }}</ref>

The city's proximity to [[Southern California]] and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called ''[[maquiladora]]s'', even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfomaquiladoras.org/dataprincipalabril05.htm|title=Maquiladora estadísticas abril 2005|author=|date=|work=cfomaquiladoras.org}}</ref> Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average (although not high paying) salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include [[Lanix]], [[Hyundai]], [[Sony]],<ref>Alberts, Hana R., [https://www.forbes.com/2009/09/01/sony-hon-hai-tv-factory-business-billionaires-terry-gou.html "Sony Hives Off Major Factory"], ''Forbes'', September 1, 2009</ref> [[Vortec]], [[BMW]], [[Vizio]], [[Toyota]], [[Dell]], [[Samsung]], [[Kodak]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita/Panasonic]], [[Bimbo]], [[GE]], [[Nabisco]], [[Ford]], [[Microsoft]], [[Cemex]], [[Zonda Telecom|Zonda]], [[Philips]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Airbus]], [[Plantronics]], [[Siemens Mexico]], [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], Pall Medical, Tara, [[Sanyo]] and [[Volkswagen]]. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.

There are also some high-tech firms and telemarketing companies in the city, drawing people with technical trade and college degrees to Tijuana. One example is Telvista, a Texas-based telemarketing company that maintains three call centers along Blvd. Agua Caliente. This makes Tijuana a popular city for migrant workers as well as college graduates from other parts of Mexico as well as other countries to the south.

Economic development has its central business district at Zona Río, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revolución), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city. {{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===Tourist economy and entertainment===
Tijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the [[San Ysidro, California|San Ysidro]] point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and [[taco stand]]s, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include [[Downtown Tijuana]] including the nightlife hot spots around [http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-sexta-tijuana La Sexta], [[Avenida Revolucion]], souvenir shopping at the ''Mercado de Artesanías'' and [[Plaza Viva Tijuana]], Tijuana's Cultural Center ([[Tijuana Cultural Center|CECUT]]) and neighboring [[Plaza Río Tijuana]] shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal [[Zona Norte, Tijuana|Red Light District]] and gambling ([[Agua Caliente, Tijuana|Agua Caliente]]). Mexico's [[drinking age]] of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revolución.

Tijuana is also known for its [[red-light district]] [[Zona Norte, Tijuana|Zona Norte]] (also referred to as ''La Coahuila'' after one of its main streets) with legal [[prostitution]] in strip clubs and on the street.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dibble |first=Sandra |date=31 October 2015 |title=Spotlight on Tijuana’s ‘tolerance zone’ |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/sdut-tijuana-tolerance-zone-2015oct31-story.html |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |location= |access-date=9 September 2018 }}</ref> The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them.<ref name="DallaBaker2011">{{cite book|author1=Rochelle L.

Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as [[list of Schedule II drugs|Schedule II]] or [[list of Schedule III drugs|Schedule III]] have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US [[Controlled Substances Act]]  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.

Businesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.

Tijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, and home to several of its casinos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grupocaliente.com.mx/|title=Grupo Caliente - Home|website=www.grupocaliente.com.mx}}</ref>

===Retail===
[[Image:MercadoHidalgoTJ.JPG|thumb|left|Mercado Hidalgo is a traditional market with vendor stalls selling food.]]
[[Plaza Rio Tijuana]] is a large regional mall anchored by [[Cinépolis]], [[Sanborns]], Súper DAX and [[Sears (Mexico)|Sears]]. 

All across the city, there are dozens of ''plazas comerciales'', which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors: 
*one of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store [[Coppel]],
*a supermarket or hypermarket,
* a [[Cinépolis]] or [[Cinemex]] multicinema,
*a branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer [[Grupo Elektra|Elektra]] 

An important concentration of ''plazas'' is in the [[Cinco y Diez]] around an eponymous intersection, si named for a former American-style [[five and dime]] store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. [[Plaza Carrousel]], with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.

[[Costco]], [[Sam's Club]] and [[Walmart]] each have multiple branches across the city.

Traditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona Río, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.

Tijuana was the headquarters of 14-store [[Dorian's]] department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears.

===Culinary===
Tijuana, along with the nearby [[Valle de Guadalupe, Baja California|Valle de Guadalupe]], has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its [[Baja Med]] cuisine, including chefs such as [[Javier Plascencia]], but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.<ref>[http://revistatravesias.com/mexico/principales/847 "''10 sorpresas gastronómicas en Tijuana'' (10 culinary surprises in Tijuana)", ''Travesías'', October 2015]</ref>

[[File:UABC-CC.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Universidad Autónoma de Baja California|UABC]] Community Center]]
Tijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, [[Instituto México]], Instituto Cumbres, President Lázaro Cárdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Politécnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QUÍMICA), José Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ramírez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.

Tijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the [[Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana]] (UABC), [[Instituto Tecnológico de Tijuana]] (ITT), [[Universidad Iberoamericana]] (UIA-Tijuana), [[Centro de Enseñanza Técnica y Superior|CETYS Universidad]], [[Universidad Xochicalco]], and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.

==Culture and contemporary life==

Many foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy [[prescription drug]]s, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at ''Plaza Fiesta'' or other areas of the [[Zona Río, Tijuana|Zona Río]] without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revolución strip. However, Avenida Revolución has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an "anything goes" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.

===Entertainment and performing arts===
[[File:GrandHotelTijuana&TJCountryClub.jpg|thumb|[[Tijuana Country Club]]]]
As Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the [[Tijuana Cultural Center]] (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing [[IMAX]] films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, café, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.

La Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages. 

Other cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo ([[Trompo]] Museum), and [[El Foro]], the former [[Jai Alai]] Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hipódromo [[Agua Caliente Racetrack]], and at the "Audiorama" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.<ref>http://www.tijuanaeventos.com/conciertos#axzz5h5Kf7eEd</ref>

The [[Tijuana Country Club]] (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large [[Rotary Club]].
===Parks and recreation===
Parque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.

===Nightlife===
Tijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding "'''La Sexta'''", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revolución, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.

===Art===
[[File:TijuanaHopeMonument.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to Hope in Otay Mesa]]

Tijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of "one of the most important new cultural meccas", according to [[Newsweek]].,<ref name="Cultural Mecca">''Strange New World''</ref> an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]] and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title = ART REVIEW Tijuana's scrappy, do-it-yourself spirit Ingenuity seizes the day as a traveling exhibition brings a vibrant creative scene across the border. |last = Pagel |first = David Pagel |publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date = 2007-01-30 |page = E–1}}</ref> Art collectives like ''Bulbo'' and film production like ''Palenque Filmaciones'' explore the use of film like the award-winning [[Tijuana Makes Me Happy]], media like television bulbo TV and print "bulbo PRESS", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.

[[Graffiti]] is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in [[wheatpaste]] and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like [[Salvador Dalí]]. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the "pieces" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.

===Music===
Among other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for [[Tijuana Brass]] and [[Los Tucanes de Tijuana]] and, more recently, the birthplace of [[Nortec]] music style and [[cultural movement|Ruidoson]], resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like [[Los Macuanos]], [[Maria y Jose]], [[Siberium]], [[Hidhawk]] and [[Harpocrates]] emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as [[mexican hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[hardcore punk|hardcore]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[black metal]] and [[house music]]. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter [[Lynda Thomas]] and [[Vanessa Zamora]], the world-renowned singer [[Julieta Venegas]], fusion rock projects like [[Tijuana No]] and international indie punk bands like [[Delux]] and [[Los Kung-Fu Monkeys]].

Musical clubs along the ''Avenida Revolución'' area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as [[new wave music]] one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.

====Stadiums====

'''Estadio Caliente'''
[[File:Estadio caliente.JPG|thumb|right|[[Estadio Caliente]]]]
The stadium is the [[Estadio Caliente]], match venue for Club Tijuana, a [[Liga MX]] [[Primera División de México|México Primera División]] [[Association football|football]] team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the México Primera División; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in México Primera División during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Gasmart stadium'''
<br>
The Gasmart Stadium for baseball is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of ''Toros de Tijuana'', which, the following year, changed its name to ''Colts'' as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets ''Calimax'' bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of ''Toros'', the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Hospital Centro Medico Excel.jpg|thumb|Excel Medical Center]]

===Utilities===
====Water====
The Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La [[Comisión Federal de Electricidad]] (CFE).

====Waste Water====
The [[International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant]] (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies,<ref>C.Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al., {1985} ''Preliminary Assessment of Environmental Effects of Sewage on San Diego Beaches'' (EIS). Prepared by Earth Metrics Inc. for the U.S. EPA, Region IX.</ref> treats 25&nbsp;million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.

The city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20&nbsp;years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the [[reclaimed water]] to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.

====Telecommunications====
Tijuana's telephonic system operates under [[Area code 664 (Mexico)|area code 664]], but it is not the same [[area code 664]] that is part of the [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an [[international access code]] and [[Telephone numbers in Mexico|Mexico's Country Code, 52]], before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.

Telephonic land lines in Tijuana are provided by the company [[Telnor]]; other companies include Axtel and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include [[Movistar]], [[Telcel]], [[Iusacell]], [[Unefon]], [[Nextel]], in conjunction with [[Nextel USA]], provides coverage in the city and all of Baja California for American Nextel users.<ref>[http://shop2.sprint.com/en/services/worldwide/baja.shtml Sprint Baja Services] on Sprint.com</ref> Nextel is popular among businessmen, students, and professionals. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.

===Transportation===
[[File:Mexico Highway1 San Diego.jpg|thumb|Fed. 1 towards San Diego and the Rio Zone]]
Tijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.

Local public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.

====Air====
The [[Tijuana International Airport]] (General Abelardo L. Rodríguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and [[Shanghai]], China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's [[Cross Border Xpress]] terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and [[Canada|Canadian]] destinations can be reached via the [[San Diego International Airport]], located about {{convert|35|km|mi|0|sp=us}} north of the international border.

====Road====
Two important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is [[Mexican Federal Highway 1|Fed 1]], which runs south through the [[Baja California Peninsula]] through [[Rosarito Beach]], [[Baja Mar]], and [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]] before ending in [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Baja California Sur]]. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. [[Mexican Federal Highway 2|Fed 2]] runs east for {{convert|1,000|km|mi|abbr=off}} near the international border, currently as far as [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].

Within the metropolitan area the [[Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000]] freeway connecte [[Mesa de Otay]] in the northeast of the city with [[Rosarito Beach]] in the southwest.

Just north of the San Ysidro border crossing, [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] and [[Interstate 805 (California)|Interstate 805]] head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, [[Interstate 905]] takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.

[[File:TJLighthouse.jpg|thumb|Tijuana Lighthouse]]

====Intercity buses====
The city's main [[bus station]] is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based [[Greyhound Lines]] and [[Crucero USA]]. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], and other major cities—including [[Mazatlán]], [[Culiacán]], [[Hermosillo]], and [[Guadalajara]]. Major [[bus]] lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte {{Not a typo|Efectivo}} Express de Tijuana – TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.

====Local buses====
In 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the ''Cinco'' y ''Diez'' avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis – black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.

====Local BRT system====
[[File:Amistad SITT BRT Tijuana.jpg|thumb|Amistad station of the SITT [[bus rapid transit]] system in Tijuana]]
A [[bus rapid transit]] system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the [[San Ysidro Port of Entry]], southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sitt.org.mx/inicio/rutasymapas/|title=SISTEMA INTEGRAL DE TRANSPORTE DE TIJUANA is under construction|website=www.sitt.org.mx}}</ref>

====Light rail====
Previously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.<ref name="lightrail">{{cite news|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetijuana/notas/n1005430.htm|title=Jorge Ramos manages support light rail project|last=|first=|date=January 14, 2009|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026185201/http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetijuana/notas/n1005430.htm|archive-date=2011-10-26|dead-url=yes|publisher=El Sol de Tijuana|df=}}</ref>

There is, however, a light rail connection to Downtown San Diego and beyond starting immediately north of the [[San Ysidro Port of Entry]] to the U.S. at the [[San Ysidro Transit Center]] where municipal buses also operate.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Tijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with the City of Tijuana are:
